# Northcoders House of Games API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Notes

In order to successfully connect to the two databases and run the project locally, the developer will need to create an _.env.development_ and an _.env.test_ file and write a line referring to the database e.g. 
```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
```
## Husky

To ensure we are not commiting broken code this project makes use of git hooks. Git hooks are scripts triggered during certain events in the git lifecycle. Husky is a popular package which allows us to set up and maintain these scripts. This project makes use a _pre-commit hook_. When we attempt to commit our work, the script defined in the `pre-commit` file will run. If any of our tests fail than the commit will be aborted.

The [Husky documentation](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) explains how to configure Husky for your own project as well as creating your own custom hooks.\_
