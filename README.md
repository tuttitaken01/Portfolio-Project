# House of Games API

## Hosted Version
https://gameview.onrender.com

## Background

The API is built for the purpose of storing, accessing, and editing a PSQL database of board game reviews. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit), which should then provide this information to the front end architecture.

To interact with the API, the user can implement HTTP requests in the browser or using software bundles, e.g. insomnia.
